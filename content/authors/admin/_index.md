Hi, I am Kejing Huang, a graduate student in Geophysics at University of Science and Technology of China, supervised by [Prof. Yan Hu.](http://ess.ustc.edu.cn/faculties/detail-31.html)

I am passionate about contributing to the research of subduction zone processes since they have giant and long-lasting impact on our earth. It is always fulfilling for me to have delved deeply into the science behind the crustal deformation processes. 

Recently, I am working on the postseismic deformation of the 1964 Mw9.2 Alaska earthquake and exploring its relationship with events afterward, such as slow slip events and inland earthquakes.
